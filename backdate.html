          Making The Dev To Team Lead Transition: How We Built Kwiksell
          <br/>
When Ray Liotta said, “As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,” I felt seen. Not that I wanted to be a gangster (Have you met me?!), but I know what it is to have a dream and then live it. This was the case for me in August 2019, when I joined Softcom. It was also my second year as a full-time frontend developer—two years of being a tech bro—and my first stint in a firm that size.
By 2021, I had worked on TixHut, Leap, GS3, and Eyowo. It was a learning curve that was about to throw me into the deep: leading a team to develop a product. The transition from dev to lead is not an easy one. It is a mental shift that gives your imposter syndrome the energy boost it really does not deserve. Do not get me wrong, it was just as exciting as it was scary.
Becoming A Team Lead
With 3 years as a frontend dev, a stack containing React and Redux majorly, the Softcom CEO decided I was ready to lead a team. I do not know what he saw, but I would like to believe it was the product of hard work, grit, availability, and just sheer refusal to let my village people win.
I was to lead a team of 5: 3 frontend engineers, 2 backend engineers, and one QA. This immediately increased to nine after 4 engineers joined the team to ensure we had an MVP in the stated timeframe. The first course of business was evaluating my team’s strengths. I had to be sure of what can be done, who can do it, and how long it will take each person to get it done. I also had to know what work-life boundaries my team was open to pushing back. This was key as we had a six-month mandate that might require after-work meetings, working weekends, impromptu sync-ups; a general obsfucation of the line between work and non-work.
At this point, I have to give a big shout-out to the team—Anisat Yunusa, Victor Aremu, Oladotun Sobande, Ire Olaniyan, Adaeze Atusiuba, Tamunobelema Miebaka-Ogan, Richard Akinyemi, Stanley  Ndunwere, Samuel Dalafiari, Simi Da-Walang, Fatimah Abdulrahman—for their perseverance, for trusting me to lead, and for going well above the call of duty when the need arose.
The next step for me was breaking the PM’s roadmap into chunks for the team. I knew I would have to lead by doing and by ensuring no one was slacking. I had to mentally move from a Kevin Durant mentality and buy heavily into the LeBron James mindset; I could no longer just play ball, I had to facilitate too.
With these done, it was time to start building Kwiksell.
Building Kwiksell
Kwiksell is a business growth tool to aid sales. It is an e-commerce product with over 1,000 merchants make sales, create invoices and reports, collect payments, and share and update their inventory. It has a global setting, teams, and a kitchen display system for restaurants. However, its first market-ready iteration, which my team worked on, had fewer modules than it does now.  At the time, our main goal was creating a Square for the Nigerian market. Our primary modules were the Items(Inventory), Make A Sale, Teams, Roles and Permissions, Reports module, Sales channel and Orders modules, adding functionalities that the market leader at the time did not provide. 
Work began in earnest in November, 2021 with the backend engineers creating APIs based on the designs provided by the design team, while the frontend engineers converted the designs. This was followed by the consumption of the APIs created by the backend team. Straightforward, right? Nah. 
We got in rhythm with the new and, like all devs around the world, kept it moving till the first of two major blockers. Things started going sideways three months in when work started on the inventory module. The first was Victor, a frontend engineer, leaving the team to go write his final exams at the Lagos State University. Thereafter, shorthanded as we were, there was a miscommunication, mostly on my part, that led to us having to re-factor the implementation of the items(inventory) module. This meant almost restarting work to ensure the variant items, parent items, pricing, and more were user-ready and compliant with the documentation. So, I gathered the team, informed them, let them know what was okay and what needed reworking, thereby giving the team the chance to retrace our steps and know where to fix. I also apologised as this error was going to make meeting the deadline harder than it already was–took on backend tasks alongside my frontend tasks–and finished in 4-5 days. We refactored a module that took us 3 weeks to finish in 4-5 days of noodles- and soda-fueled all-nighters. Then we pushed to QA for testing. It passed.
The second is the usually no-so-tricky payment integration. It usually is the easy ones that manage to become complicated. This blocker had to be navigated carefully as it was outside my team but was still an in-house issue. Kwiksell's payment structure was powered by Eyowo, which at the time was undergoing major upgrades, re-engineering, and scaling, making integration difficult. With time, several “can you jump on a quick call?” and a few physical meetings, we got this solved. 
In August 2021, we provided an MVP-viable product to plenty (virtual) back pats, sighs of relief, and a mental switch ahead of the next project.
Takeaways From Building Kwiksell
Leading a team is about trust and (copious!) patience. It is also about meetings, communication, and updates. Ezekiel, I love you, but I wish you let the 10-minute standups be so. Not an hour. In your defence, you used the time to also know how we are.
Leading is also knowing the buck stops at your door. This means you must be on top of things, catch slacks before they become issues, and as best as you can, shield your team. 
Team bonding is a very important component of team success. We had knowledge sessions every Friday, led by pre-selected members of the team. These sessions were an avenue to teach, discuss, crack jokes, and stay on point. It is also important for engineering processes to be set and duly followed. This comes in handy when upper management starts asking how things are and as the deadline looms closer. If there is no structure, you create an opening for people trying to cut corners, be less detailed, and for those damnable bugs to sneak through.
Get it right the first time. It saves more time than hoping to catch it later. You won't be the one to catch it. Your boss will. During the general meeting. As the client listens in.
