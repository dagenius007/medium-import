            Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the
            information they need. These days most companies rely heavly on
            slack for all round communication and notifcation. Nest js is a
            progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and
            scalable server-side applications. Angular 2+ will find Nest js much
            easier to grabs as it has exactly the programming patterns(OOP ,
            dependecy injections, e.t.c.). We are not here to talk about Nest js
            but it so comfortable and easy to learn(Documentation is perfect!!!)

            In this article, I will be showing how you can use slack as a
            monitoring & alerting tool.Be aware there are so many monitoring
            tools out there which can as well been integrated to slack via
            Zapier. I won't be diving into that in this article. The main goal
            of this article is to communicate directly with slack API and get
            notified. We will sending slack notifications on every error.

          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowlege of Nest Js</li>
            <li>Slack Workspace</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Steps</h4>

          <h4>2. Add Slack App</h4>

            This step requires admistrator privileges in the workspace for this
            step. We will adding Incoming Webhooks.

            Even though this is not a replacement for all those fancy monitoring
            tools, a lot can be achieved with this either to your own good or
            for the business side. There is nothing more satisfying to have a
            live feed of orders on your screen and watching them coming in so
            fast you can barely keep up with the scrolling
